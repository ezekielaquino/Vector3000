# Vector3000

Ezekiel's personal toolkit for creating things with 2D vectors.

( ˘ ³˘)ノ°ﾟº❍｡

This repo will grow/shrink/evolve as I go about doing projects, so, always a WIP.

I've noticed that I've been using common methods across some projects so it made sense to actually make a little module for my own use, which might be useful for you too.

## Usage
Add as a dependency via `npm i vector3000` or `yarn add vector3000`. Please consult `index.ts` for available methods you can import.
